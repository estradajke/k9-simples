k9: Manual
**********

This manual is for Shakti (k9) build 2021.03.12.

The Shakti programming language is the work of Arthur Whitney and the team at Shakti.  The language comes from a lineage of similar languages going back to APL. It's also known as k9 given the
similarities to k, k2, ..., k6, k7 and the fact that Arthur also wrote those.  k9 is still under development so expect a bit of syntax change and likely even more improvements.

Learning k9 means code like '{x@(!#x)+\!#y}' is clear and actually prefered to something much longer and verbose.  You'll have to go a bit down the rabbit hole before it starts to come together but once
it does you'll probably be happy you gave it a chance and end up learning a few things.  You'll understand how fast k9 can be in processing and analyzing data and how terse code is less likely to
contain errors.  Unfortunately you will be less likely to be content using more bloated and slow frameworks.

Alas this manual is not as elegant as the k9 language in that the text version of this document is almost as big as the binary of the language.

1 Introduction
**************

The k9 programming language is designed primarily for the analysis of data.  It may surprise new users with two rather different paradigms, (1) fast data analysis and (2) concise syntax.  After you
become familiar with the language, these features will both seem normal and intuitive.  Also, going back to slow and verbose programming will be surprisingly difficult.

1.1 Going fast
==============

Imagine you have a small, on-disk, 100 million row database containing a time-series with two float values at each time.  Additionally this data could be split in three different tables covering
different measurements.  Here's how fast k9 can read in the data from disk and compute a statistic, average difference over each table, which uses each and every row.

This section requires 2: a feature only in the enterprise version of Shakti.

      bash-3.2$ ./k
      2020.xx.xx 17GB 4core (c) shakti
      \t q:2:`q;{select s:avg a-b from x}'q[!q]
     495

That's 495 ms to read the data in from disk and compute over all the 100 million values.  The data read is the biggest bit.  If the data were already in memory then the computation would be faster:

      \t {select s:avg a-b from x}'q[!q]
     230

230 ms, not bad for 100 million calculations.

The code to generate the on-disk database is presented below.  Speed of course will depend on your hardware so times will vary.

      nf:d+*|d:(|-d),d:683 954 997 1000;
      T:^`t rand[;_8.64e7]@
      B:100++\1e-2*-3+nf bin/:rand[;*|nf]@
      S:rand[;1e-2*2,2,8#1]@
      L:{select t,b,a:b+s from +`t`b`s!(T;B;S)@'x}
      q:`eurusd`usdjpy`usdchf!L'_60e6 20e6 20e6
      `q 2:q

1.2 Going concise
=================

The k9 language is more closely related to mathematics syntax than most programming lanauges.  It requires the developer to learn to "speak" k9 but once that happens most find an ability to speak
quicker and more accurately in k9 than in other languages.  At this point an example might help.

In mathematics, "3+2" is read as "3 plus 2" as you learn at an early age that "+" is the "plus" sign.  For trival operations like arithmetic most programming languages use symbols also.  When moving
beyond arithmetic, most programming lanauges switch to words while k9 remains with symbols.  As an example, to determine the distinct values of a list most programming languages might use a syntax like
'distinct()' while k9 uses '?'.  This requires the developer to learn how to say a number of symbols but once that happens it results in much shorter code that is quicker to write, easier to inspect,
and easier to maintain.

This should not be surprising.  In arithmetic, which do you find easier to understand?

     / math with text
     Three plus two times open parenthesis six plus fourteen close parenthesis

     / math with symbols
     3+2*(6+14)

In code, if you're new to k9 then it's unlikley you can understand the second example.

     / code with text
     x = (0,12,3,11,3);y=5;
     distinct_x = list(set(x));
     sorted(i for i in distinct_x if i >= y)

     / code with symbols
     x:0 12 3 11 3;y:5;
     z@&y<z:?x

When you first learned arithmetic you likely didn't have a choice.  Now you have a choice whether or not you want to learn k9.  If you give it a try, then you'll likely get it quickly and move onto the
power phase fast enough that you'll be happy you gave it a chance.

1.3 Get k9.
===========

<https://shakti.com>

k9 is available in two versions, standard (under download) and enterprise.  The enterprise version has additional features indicated on the k9 help page and also indicated in this tutorial.

Once downloaded you will need to change the file mode with the following commmand

      chmod +x k

On the mac if you then attempt to run this file you likely won't succeed due to MacOS security.  You'll need to go to "System Preferences..."  and then "Security and Privacy" and select to allow this
binary to run.  (You'll have to have tried and failed to have it appear here automatically.)

On linux (and macos if you have installed npm) one can download k from the command line via

      npm i @kparc/k -g

1.4 Help / Info Card
====================

Typing '\' in a terminal window gives you a concise overview of the language.  This document aims to provide details to beginning user where the help screen is a bit too terse.  Some commands are not
available in the basic version and thus marked with an asterisk, eg.  *4: https get.

python:from k import k;k('+',2,3);nodejs:k=require('k').k;k('+',2,3)
*ffi:"./a.so"5:`a!"fi" //double a(int x){return 2.3+x;}

/comment \trace [:return 'signal if do while] \\exit

1.5 rlwrap
==========

Although you only need the 'k' binary to run k9 most will also install rlwrap, if not already installed, in order to get command history in a terminal window.  rlwrap is "Readline wrapper: adds readline
support to tools that lack it" and allows one to arrow up to go through the command buffer history.

In order to start k9 you should either run 'k' or 'rlwrap k' to get started.  Here I will show both options but one should run as desired.  In this document lines with input are shown with a leading
space and output will be without.  In the examples below the user starts a terminal window in the directory with the 'k' binary file.  Then the users enters 'rlwrap ./k <RET>'.  k9 starts and displays
the date of the build, (c), and shakti and then listens to user input.  In this example I have entered the command to exit k9, '\\'.  Then I start k9 again without rlwrap and again exit the session.

      rlwrap ./k
     Sep 13 2020 16GB (c) shakti
      \\

      ./k
     Sep 13 2020 16GB (c) shakti
      \\

1.6 Simple example
==================

Here I will start up k9, perform some trivial calculations, and then close the session.  After this example it will be assumed the user will have a k9 session running and working in repl mode.  Comments
('/') will be added to the end of lines as needed.  One can review *note plus::, *note enum::, *note floor:: and *note timing:: as needed.

      1+2  / add 1 and 2
     3

      !5   / generate a list of 5 integers from 0 to 4
     0 1 2 3 4

      1+!5 / add one to each element of the list
     1 2 3 4 5

      !_100e6;     / generate a list of 100 million integers (suppress output with ;)
      1+!_100e6;   / do 100 million sums
      \t 1+!_100e6 / time the operations in milliseconds
     82

Now let's exit the session.

      \\
     bash-3.2$

1.7 Document formatting for code examples
=========================================

This document uses a number of examples to familiarize the reader with k9.  The sytax is to have input with a leading space and output without a leading space.  This follows the terminal syntax where
the REPL input has space but prints output without.
      3+2 / this is input
     5    / this is output

1.8 k9 idiosyncracies
=====================

One will need to understand some basic rules of k9 in order to progress.  These may seem strange at first but the faster you learn them, the faster you'll move forward.  Also, some of them, like
overloading based on number of arguments, add a lot of expressability to the language.

1.8.1 Colon (':') is used to set a variable to a value
------------------------------------------------------

'a:3' is used to set the variable, a, to the value, 3.  'a=3' is an equality test to determine if a is equal to 3.

1.8.2 Percent ('%') is used to divide numbers
---------------------------------------------

Yeah, 2 divided by 5 is written as '2%5', not '2/5'.  This choice is because '%' is similar to ÷, and the \ and / symbols are used elsewhere.

1.8.3 Evaluation is done right to left
--------------------------------------

2+5*3 is 17 and 2*5+3 is 16.  2+5*3 is first evaluated on the right most portion, 5*3, and once that is computed then it proceeds with 2+15.  2*5+3 goes to 2*8 which becomes 16.

1.8.4 There is no arithmetic order
----------------------------------

+ has equal precedence as *.  The order of evaluation is done right to left unless parenthesis are used.  (2+5)*3 = 21 as the 2+5 in parenthesis is done before being multiplied by 3.

1.8.5 Operators are overloaded depending on the number of arguments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

      *(13;6;9)    / single argument: * returns the first element
     13
      2*(13;6;9)   / two arguments: * is multiplication
     26 12 18

1.8.6 Lists and functions are very similar.
-------------------------------------------

k9 syntax encourages you to treat lists and functions in a similar function.  They should both be thought of a mapping from a value to another value or from a domain to a range.  Lists and functions do
not have the same type.

      l:3 4 7 12
      f:{3+x*x}
      l@2
     7
      f@2
     7
      @l
     `I
      @f
     `.

1.8.7 k9 notions of Noun, Verb, and Adverb
------------------------------------------

k9 uses an analogy with grammar to describe language syntax.  The k9 grammar consists of nouns (data), verbs (functions) and adverbs (function modifiers).
   * The boy ate an appple. (Noun verb noun)
   * The girl ate each olive. (Noun verb adverb noun)
In k9 as the Help/Info card shows data are nouns, functions/lists are verbs and modifiers are adverbs.
   * 3 > 2 (Noun verb noun)
   * 3 >' (1 12;1 4 5) (Noun verb adverb noun)

2 Verbs
*******

This chapter covers verbs which are the core primitives of k9.  Given how different is it to call functions in k9 than in most other languages, you may have to read this chapter a few times.  Once you
can "speak" k9 you'll read '|x' better than 'reverse(x)'.

Most functions are overloaded and change depending on the number of arguments.  This can confuse new users.  Eg.  '(1 4)++(2 3;5 6;7 8)' contains the plus symbol once as flip and then for addition.
(Remember evaluation is right to left!)

There are verbs that can take a function argument.  Those are listed with a '[f]' prefix.  These include [f]cut, [f]take, and [f]drop.  A few can take a special name prefix and those are listed with a
'n' prefix and include [n]find, and [n]at.

3 Adverbs
*********

This chapter may be one of the most difficult for users new to array langauges but one must master adverbs to exploit the full power of k9.  Nouns and verbs naturally come but adverbs need to be learned
so that one can reach for them when needed.

     Adverb
        f'  *note each::
     [x]f/  *note over: scan.      c/ *note join::
     [x]f\  *note scan::      c\ *note split::
     [y]f': *note eachprior::
        f/: *note eachright:: g/:*note over: cover.
        f\: *note eachleft::  g\:*note scan: cscan.

Adverbs modify verbs to operative iteratively over nouns.  This previous sentence likely will make sense only once you understand it so let's jump into an example.  Imagine you have a list of 4 lists.
Using 'first' you will retrieve the first sub-list.  In order to retrieve the first element of each sub-list you'll have to modify the function 'first' with a modifier 'each'.

      x:(1 2; 3 4; 5 6; 7 8);x
     1 2
     3 4
     5 6
     7 8

     *x   / first
     1 2

     *'x  / each first
     1 3 5 7

Adverbs area also used where one might use a 'for', 'do', or 'while' loop to calculate over a list of value or recursively until a condition is met.

      f:{x*y}
      f\1 .1 .1 .1 / f\ scan over list

3.1 each => f'x
===============

Apply function f to each value in list x in a single thread.  Multithread operation is done with *note eachprior::.

      *((1 2 3);4;(5 6);7)   / first element of the list
     1 2 3

      *'((1 2 3);4;(5 6);7)  / first element of each element
     1 4 5 7

      !3                     / simple list
     0 1 2
      +/!3                   / sum of the list
     3
      2#'!3                  / take 5 copies of the list
     0 0
     1 1
     2 2
      +/2#'!3                / sum
     3 3
      +/'2#'!3               / sum each, eg. (0 1 2)+(0 1 2)
     0 2 4

3.2 over => f/y or x f/y
========================

Over has the same function as *note scan:: but returns only the last value.

3.3 scan => f\y or x f\y
========================

Compute f, a function of two arguments, over list y with optional initial value x.  On the first iteration return y_{0}.  On each subsequent iteration function will be called with previous output and
the next element of y as arguments, i.e.  f_{i}=f[f_{i-1};y_{i}].  Calling with f, a function of one argument, is covered in *note each::.

     11 12 13
     21 22 23
     31 32 33

3.4 join => c/x
===============

Join a list of strings x using character c between each pair.

      "-"/("Some";"random text";"plus";,".")
     "Some-random text-plus-."

The notaion c/x converts a list of integers x via base c into base 10.  In the example below, assuming 2 0 1 are digits in base 8, they convert to 1 + (0*8) + (2*8*8) = 129

      8/2 0 1
     129

3.5 split => c\x
================

Split the string x using character c to determine the locations.

      " "\"Here is a short sentence."
     Here
     is
     a
     short
     sentence.

c\x splits a number x into base c digits.

      8\129
     2 0 1

3.6 eachprior => f':[x;y] or y f':x
===================================

Compute f, a function of two arguments, over list x with optional initial value y.  Concretely f_{i}=f[x_{i};x_{i-1}] where f_{0} returns f[x_{0};i].

      ,':[`i;(`$"x",'$!5)]
     x0 i
     x1 x0
     x2 x1
     x3 x2
     x4 x3

      %':[100;100 101.9 105.1 102.3 106.1] / compute returns
     1 1.019 1.031403 0.9733587 1.037146

      100%':100 101.9 105.1 102.3 106.1    / using infix notation
     1 1.019 1.031403 0.9733587 1.037146

      101.9{($x)," % ",($y)," = ",$x%y}':100.1 101.9 105.1 102.3 106.1
     100.1 % 101.9 = 0.9823356
     101.9 % 100.1 = 1.017982
     105.1 % 101.9 = 1.031403
     102.3 % 105.1 = 0.9733587
     106.1 % 102.3 = 1.037146

Additionally eachp (':) is a multithreaded (parallel) each.  This will allow a function to run using multiple threads over a list of arguments.

     \t {L:xrand 1.;sum L%sin L*cos L*sin L+L*L}':8#_50e6 / multiple threads
     831

     \t {L:xrand 1.;sum L%sin L*cos L*sin L+L*L}'8#_50e6  / single thread
     1202

3.7 eachright => f/:[x;y]
=========================

Apply f[x;y] to each value of y, i.e.  the right one.

      (!2)+/:!3
     0 1
     1 2
     2 3

      {x+10*y}/:[!2;!3]
     0 1
     10 11
     20 21

3.8 eachleft => f\:[x;y]
========================

Apply f[x;y] to each value of x, i.e.  the left one.

      (!2)+\:!3
     0 1 2
     1 2 3

      {x+10*y}\:[!2;!3]
     0 10 20
     1 11 21

3.9 Converge Over => g/:x or (n;g)/:x
=====================================

Converge Over is the same function as *note Converge Scan: cscan. but only returns the final value(s).

      r:((1;2);3;(,4));r
     1 2
     3
     ,4

      ,//:r  / raze over the list until it converges to a flat list
     1 2 3 4

3.10 Converge Scan => g\:x or (n;g)\:x
======================================

Compute function g where g_{i}=g[g_{i-1}] and g_{0}=x.  If n is specified then it is either (DO) the number of iterations or (WHILE) a function returning a non-zero result.

       {x*x}\:.99           / converge to value
     0.99 0.9801 0.9605961 ... 1.323698e-18 1.752177e-36 0.

4 Noun
******

The basic data types of the k9 language are booleans, numbers (integer and float), text (characters and enumerated/name) and temporal (date and time).  It is common to have functions operate on multiple
data types.

In additional to the basic data types, data can be put into lists (uniform, i.e., all elements of the same type, and non-uniform), dictionaries (key-value pairs), and tables (transposed/flipped
dictionaries).  Dictionaries and tables will be covered in anohter chapter.

Here are some examples of each of these types (note that 0N is a null integer and 0n a null float).

     type
     *note bool:: 011b
     *note int::  0N 0 2 3
     *note flt::  0n 0 2 3.4
     *note char:: " ab"
     *note name:: ``ab
     *note uuid::

     *note date:: 2024.01.01
     *note time:: 12:34:56.123456789

Data types can be determined by using the '@' function on values or lists of values.  In the case of non-uniform lists '@' returns the type of the list '`L' but the function can be modified to evaluate
the type of each element in the list using '@''.

      @1            / integer atom
     `i
      @1 2 3        / integer list
     `I
      @12:34:56.789 / time atom
      @(3;3.1;"b";`a;12:01:02.123;2020.04.05) / mixed list
     `L
      @'(3;3.1;"b";`a;12:01:02.123;2020.04.05)
     `i`f`c`n`t`d

4.1 Atom Types
==============

This section lists all the different types available.  Generally lower case specifies atoms and upper case as lists.

4.2 bool => Boolean b
=====================

Booleans have two possible values 0 and 1 and have a 'b' to avoid confusion with integers, eg.  0b or 1b.

4.3 Numeric Data
================

Numbers can be stored as integers and floats.

4.3.1 int => Integer g, h, i, j
-------------------------------

Integers can be stored in four different ways which correspond 1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes.  The first three are unsigned and the last (j) is signed.  Positive numbers default to i and negative and very large
numbers default to j.  One can specify a non-default type by adding one of the four letters immediately following the number.

      @37    / will default to i
     `i
      @-37   / negative so will default to j
     `j

      @37g   / cast as g, one byte unsigned
     `g

     b:{-1+*/x#256}
      `g b[1]
     255g
      `h b[2]

4.4 Text Data
=============

Text data come in characters, lists of characters (aka strings) and enumerated types.  Enumerated types are displayed as text but stored internally as integers.

4.4.1 char => Character c
-------------------------

Characters are stored as their ANSI value and can be seen by conversion to integers.  A string is a list of characters (including blanks).

      @"b"
     `c
      @"bd"
     `C

4.4.2 name => Name n
--------------------

A name is an enumerated type displayed as a text string but stored internally as an integer value.

      @`blue
     `n
      @`blue`red
     `N

4.5 Unique Identifier
=====================

4.5.1 uuid => Uuid
------------------

TBD

4.6 Temporal Data
=================

Temporal data can be expressed as time, date, or a combined date and time.

4.6.1 time => Time s, t, u, v
-----------------------------

Time has four types depending on the level of precision.  The types are seconds (s), milliseconds (t), microseconds (u), and nanoseconds (v).  The times are all stored internally as integers.  The
integers are the number of time units.  For example 00:00:00.012 and 00:00:00.000000012 are both stored as 12 internally.

      @12:34:56.789             / time
     `t
      .z.t                       / current time in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)
     17:32:57.995
      t: .z.t-17:30:00.000; t
     00:03:59.986
      t
     17:33:59.986
      `i 00:00:00.001            / numeric representation of 1ms
     1
      `i 00:00:01.000            / numeric representation of 1s
     1000
      `i 00:01:00.000            / numeric representation of 1m
     60000
      `t 12345                   / convert number to milliseconds
     00:00:12.345

4.6.2 date => Date d
--------------------

Dates are in yyyy.mm.dd format.  Dates are stored internally as integers with 0 corresponding to 2001.01.01.

      @2020.04.20               / date
     `d
      .z.d                       / current date in GMT
     2020.12.05
      `i .z.d                    / numeric representation of date
     7278
      `i 2001.01.01              / zero date
     0
      `d 0                       / zero date
     2001.01.01

4.6.3 datetime => Datetime d
----------------------------

Dates and times can be combined into a single datetime element by combining a date, the letter T, and the time together without spaces.  The datetime use the same lettering as the time precision but in
uppercase.  Datetimes are stored interally as integers.  For example 2001.01.02T00:00:00.000 is stored as 86,400,000, the number of milliseconds in a day.

      @2020.04.20T12:34:56.789  / date and time
     `d
      `T$"2020.04.20 12:34:56.789" / converting from string
     2020.04.20T12:34:56.789

4.7 Extreme values
==================

Data types can represent in-range, null, and out-of-range values.

type                           null                           out of range
i                              0N                             0W
f                              0n                             0w

5 List
******

Lists and derivatives of lists are fundamental to k9 which makes sense given that the language is made to process large quantites of data.  Performance will be best when working with uniform lists of a
single data type but k9 supports list of non-uniform type also.

Lists are automatically formed when a sequence of uniform type are entered or generated by any function.

      1 3 12      / list of ints
     1 3 12

      3.1 -4.1 5. / list of floats
     3.1 -4.1 5.

      "abc"       / list of chars
     "abc"

      `x`y`z      / list of names
     `x`y`z

In order to determine if data is an atom or a list, one can use the *note type:: command.  The command returns a lower case value for atoms and an upper case value for lists.

      @1          / an integer
     `i

     @1 3 12     / list of ints
     `I

     @,1         / list of single int via *note list: enlist.
     `I

Commands that generate sequences of numbers return lists regardless of whether the count (length of the list) is 1 or many.

      @!0
     `I
      @!1
     `I
      @!2
     `I

5.1 List Syntax
===============

In general, lists consist of elements separated by semicolons and encased by parenthesis.

      (1;3;12)         / list of ints
     1 3 12

     @(1;3.;`a;"b")   / non-uniform list
     `L

     @((1;3);(12;0))  / list of integer lists
     LI

     @'((1;3);(12;0)) / each list is type I
     `I`I

     ,,,,,(3;1)      / a list of a list of a list..
     ,,,,,3 1

5.2 List Indexing
=================

Lists can be indexed in different ways.  The @ notation is often used as it's fewer characters than [] and the explicit @ instead of space is likely more clear.

      a:2*1+!10 / 2 4 ... 20
      a[9]      / square bracket
     20
      a@9       / at
     20
      a 9       / space
     20
      a(9)      / parenthesis
     20
      a[10]     / out of range return zero
     0

5.3 Updating List Elements
==========================

Lists can be updated elementwise by setting the indexed element to a required value.  There is also a syntax for updating many elements and that is found at *note amend::.

      a:2*1+!10;a
     2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
      a[3]:80
      a
     2 4 6 80 10 12 14 16 18 20

5.4 Function Applied to Lists
=============================

Most functions can be applied to lists without special syntax as if it was an element.

      x:!3;x
     0 1 2

      x+10
     10 11 12

      +\x
     0 1 3

      +/x
     3

      {x*x:sin x}[x]
     0 0.7080734 0.8268218

5.5 Functions Applied to Two Lists
==================================

This section will focus on functions (f) that operate on two lists (x and y).  As these are internal functions, examples will be shown with infix notation (x+y) but prefix notation (+[x;y]) would also
be possible.

5.5.1 Pairwise
--------------

These functions operate on list elements pairwise and thus requires that x and y are equal length.
   * x+y : Add
   * x-y : Subtract
   * x*y : Multiply
   * x%y : Divide
   * x&y : AND/Min
   * x|y : OR/Max
   * x>y : Greater Than
   * x<y : Less Than
   * x=y : Equals
   * x!y : Dictionary

      x:1+!5; y:10-2*!5
      x
     1 2 3 4 5
      y
     10 8 6 4 2
      x+y
     11 10 9 8 7
      x-y
     -9 -6 -3 0 3
      x*y
     10 16 18 16 10
      x%y
     0.1 0.25 0.5 1 2.5f
      x&y
     1 2 3 4 2
      x|y
     10 8 6 4 5
      x>y
     00001b
      x<y
     11100b
      x=y
     00010b
      x!y
     1|10
     2| 8
     3| 6
     4| 4
     5| 2

5.5.2 Each Element of One List Compared to Entire Other List
------------------------------------------------------------

These functions compare x[i] to y or x to y[i].  They are not symmetric to their inputs, i.e.  f[x;y] does not equal f[y;x];

   * x^y : Reshape all element in y by x
   * x#y : List all elements in x that appear in y
   * x?y : Indices of elements of y in x else return the length of x.

      x:0 2 5 10
      y:!20
      x^y
     0 1
     2 3 4
     5 6 7 8 9
     10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

      x:2 8 20
      y:1 2 3 7 8 9
      x#y
     2 8
      x?y
     3 0 3 3 1 3

5.5.3 Each List Used Symmetrically
----------------------------------

This is symmetric in its inputs f[x;y]=f[y;x] and the lists are not required to be equal length.

   * x_y : Values present in only one of the two lists

      x:2 8 20
      y:1 2 3 7 8 9
      x_y
     1 3 7 9

6 Dictionary
************

Dictionaries are a data type of key-value pairs typically used to retrieve the value by using the key.  In other computer languages they are also known as associative arrays and maps.  Keys should be
unique to avoid lookup value confusion but uniqueness is not enforced.  The values in the dictionary can be single elements, lists, tables, or even other dictionaries.

Dictionaries in k9 are often used.  As an example from finance, market quotes and trade data are dictionaries of symbols (name keys) and market data (table values).

6.1 Dictionary Creation => x!y or [x;y]
=======================================

Dictionaries are created by using the key symbol or square bracket notation and listing the keys (x) and values (y).

'x!y'

      d0:`a37!12; d0                          / key is `a37 and value is 12
     a37|12

      d1:`pi`e`c!3.14 2.72 3e8;d1             / three keys `pi, `e, `c
     pi|3.14
     e |2.72
     c |3e+08

      `a`b`c!(1 2 3;10 20 30;100 200 300 499) / values are lists
     a|1 2 3
     b|10 20 30
     c|100 200 300 499

'[x:y]'

      d0:[a37:12]
     a37|12

      d1:[pi:3.14;e:2.72;c:3e8];d1
     pi|3.14
     e |2.72
     c |3e+08

      [a:1 2 3;b:10 20 30;c:100 200 300]
     a|1 2 3
     b|10 20 30
     c|100 200 300

Often one will need to modify the data while building the dictionary.  User defined functions can easily accomplish this task.

      `x`sinX`cosX!{(x;sin y;cos z)} . 3#,0.1*(!62)
     x   |0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 ..
     sinX|0 0.09983342 0.1986693 0.2955202 0.3894183 0..
     cosX|1 0.9950042 0.9800666 0.9553365 0.921061 0.8..


6.2 Dictionary Join => x,y
==========================

This joins dictionaries together and the right or y dictionary will overwrite the left or x dictionary if common keys are present.

      d1:`a`b`c!3 2 1;d1
     a|3
     b|2
     c|1

      d2:`c`d`e!90 80 70;d2
     c|90
     d|80
     e|70

      ^d1,d2 / ^ sort by key
     a| 3
     b| 2
     c|90
     d|80
     e|70

      ^d2,d1 / ^ sort by key
     a| 3
     b| 2
     c| 1
     d|80
     e|70

6.3 Dictionary Indexing => x@y
==============================

Dictionaries, like lists, can be key indexed in a number of ways.

      x:`a`b`c!(1 2;3 4;5 6);x
     a|1 2
     b|3 4
     c|5 6

     x@`a   / single index
     1 2

     x@`a`c / multiple index
     1 2
     5 6

     / all these notations for indexing work (output not shown)
      x@`b;  / at
      x(`b); / parenthesis
      x `b;  / space
      x[`b]; / square bracket

6.4 Dictionary Key => !x
========================

The keys from a dictionary are retreived by using the !  function.

      !d0
     `pi`e`c
      !d1
     `time`temp
      !d2
     0 10 1

6.5 Dictionary Value => x[]
===========================

The values from a dictionary are retrieved using bracket notation.

      d0[]
     3.14 2.72 3e+08
      d1[]
     12:00 12:01 12:10
     25.   25.1  25.6

      d2[]
     37.4 46.3 0.1

One could return a specific value by indexing into a specific location.  As an example, in order to query the first value of the values associated with the key temp from d1, one would convert d1 into
values (a pair of lists), and index that by [1;0].

      d1
     time|12:00 12:01 12:10
     temp|25 25.1 25.6

      d1[]
     12:00 12:01 12:10
     25    25.1  25.6

      d1[][1]
     25 25.1 25.6
      d1[][1;0]
     25.

6.6 Sorting a Dictionary by Key => ^x
=====================================

      d0
     pi|3.14
     e |2.72
     c |3e+08

      ^d0
     c |3e+08
     e |2.72
     pi|3.14

6.7 Sorting a Dictionary by Value => <x (>x)
============================================

      d0
     pi|3.14
     e |2.72
     c |3e+08

      <d0
     e |2.72
     pi|3.14
     c |3e+08

      >d0
     c |3e+08
     pi|3.14
     e |2.72

6.8 Flipping a Dictionary into a Table => +x
============================================

This command flips a dictionary into a table and will be covered in detail in the table chapter.

      d1
     time|12:00 12:01 12:10
     temp|25 25.1 25.6

      +d1
     time  temp
     ----- ----
     12:00 25
     12:01 25.1
     12:10 25.6

      d1~+d1
     0b

6.9 Functions that operate on each value in a dictionary
========================================================

There are a number of simple functions on dictionaries that operate on their values.  If 'f' is a function then f applied to a dictionary returns a dictionary with the same keys and the values resulting
from the application of 'f'.

   * -d : Negate
   * d + N : Add N to d
   * d - N : Subtract N from d
   * d * N : Multiple d by N
   * d % N : Divide d by N
   * |d : Reverse
   * <d : Sort Ascending
   * >d : Sort Descending
   * ~d : Not d
   * &d : Given d:x!y output each x, y times, where y must be an integer
   * =d : Given d:x!y y!x

Examples
      d2
      0|37.4
     10|46.3
      1|0.1

      -d2
      0|-37.4
     10|-46.3
      1|-0.1

      d2+3
      0|40.4
     10|49.3
      1|3.1

      d2-1.7
      0|35.7
     10|44.6
      1|-1.6

      d2*10
      0|374
     10|463
      1|1

      d2%100
      0|0.374
     10|0.463
      1|0.001

6.10 Functions that return over values from a dictionary
========================================================

There are functions on dictionaries that operate over the values.  Given function f applied to a dictionary d, f d returns one or more values without the original keys.

   * *d : First value
      d0
     pi|3.14
     e |2.72
     c |3e+08

      *d0

7 User-defined Functions
************************

User-defined functions are treated as verbs in k9, so can benefit from the adverbs.

Multi-line functions must be defined with an initial space on all lines except the first.  These can be loaded into memory by using the *note \l: load. command and then used by calling by name.

     Func {[a;b]a+b}

7.1 Function arguments
======================

Functions default to arguments of x, y, and z for the first three parameters but one can explicitly spell out these or other argument names.  Given k9's terseness, many k9 programmers prefer short
variable names.  But this is a matter of taste.

      f1:{x+2*y}         / implicit arguments x and y
      f1[2;10]
     22

      f2:{[x;y]x+2*y}    / explicit
      f2[2;10]
     22

      f3:{[g;h]g+2*h}    / explicit arguments other than x and y
      f3[2;10]
     22

      f4:{[please;dont]please+2*dont} / longer argument names are possible
      f4[2;10]
     22

      @f1
     `.

7.2 Function Defitions
======================

Functions can have intermediate calcuations and local variables.  Function local variables do not affect the values of global variables.

      a:3;a
     3

      f:{a:12;x:sqrt x;x+a}

      f 10
     15.16228

     a
     3

7.3 Function Return
===================

Function return the last value in the definition unless the definition ends with a semicolon in which case the function returns nothing.

      f:{x+2;};f 10  / returns nothing because of final semi-colon

      f:{x+2;27};f 10  / returns the last value which is 27
     27

      f:{x+2};f 10
     12

7.4 Calling functions
=====================

Functions, like lists, can be called in a variety of ways.  Typically one uses square bracket notation when the function takes multiple argruments.  If a function is called with fewer than the required
number of arguments then it will return a function that requires the remaining arguemnts.

      f1:{[x] x}
      f2:{[x;y](x;y)}
      f3:{[x;y;z](x;y;z)}

      f1[`a]
     `a

      f2[37;`a]
     37
     a

      f3["hi";37;`a]
     hi
     37
     a

      f2[37]
     {[x;y](x;y)}[37]
      f2[;`a]
     {[x;y](x;y)}[;`a]

      f1[`a]
     `a
      f1 `a
     `a
      f1@`a
     `a

7.5 Anonymous functions
=======================

It's possible to define a function without naming it.  If the function is to be used in just one place, this can make sense.

      {x+2*y}[2;10]
     22

7.6 Recursive functions
=======================

k9 allows one to define a function which calls itself.  Care should be taken to avoid an infinite loop.

      f:{$[x>1;x*f@x-1;1]};f 5
     120

7.7 Chained functions
=====================

It may be necessary to define a function to call a function without specifying arguments.  Imagine this trivial case.

      fa:{!x}
      fb:{x+2} fa
     {x+2}
     ^
     :rank

In order to succeed fa needs to have an '@' in the definition of fb.  This is required because fb calls fa without specifying an argument for fa.  So the argument for fb becomes the argument for fa so
the net effect is 2 + !3.

      fa:{!x}
      fb:{x+2} fa@
      fb 3

8 Expression Evaluation
***********************

k9 has a compact way to evaluate expressions on dictionaries.  This allows one to use the dictionary keys as local variables to get to results with less code.

Expr :a+b

8.1 expr => x :y
================

Evaluate expression(s) 'y' on table or dictionary 'x'.  The space between 'x' and ':' is required otherwise it becomes *note set::, i.e., assignment.

      d:[city:`Chongqing`Shanhai`Beijing`Delhi`Chengdu]; d
     city|`Chongqin`Shanhai`Beijing`Delhi`Chengdu

      d,:[country:`cn`cn`cn`in`cn;size:30 24 22 17 16] ; d
     city   |`Chongqin`Shanhai`Beijing`Delhi`Chengdu
     country|`cn`cn`cn`in`cn
     size   |30 24 22 17 16

      d :&country=`in       / using country like a local variable
     ,3

      d :sum'size@=country  / sum size by country
     cn|92
     in|17

      d :+/size*country=`cn
     92

As keys come in scope as variables, variables fall out of scope.  One can evaluate the variable name as string to get around this.

      d :sum size@&size>20
     76

      x:20;
      d :sum size@&size>x  / out of scope
     !value

      d :sum size@&size>."x"
     76

Reorder a table using column index and expresssions.

      t:[[]x:`b`a`c;y:1 3 2];t
     x y
     - -
     b 1
     a 3
     c 2

      t@<t :y
     x y
     - -
     b 1
     c 2
     a 3

      t@<t`y
     x y
     - -
     b 1
     c 2

11 I/O and Interface
********************

In order to support fast data analysis, k9 supports fast input and output (I/O). If you have the habit of making tea while a huge csv file loads, you might have to opt to take a few sips from a glass of
water instead.

k9 is also able to interface with other languages so one doesn't need to translate everything you've already written in those other languages to k9.

      i/o(*enterprise)
      0: *note r: r line./*note w: w line. line
      1: *note r: r byte./*note w: w byte. char
     *2: *note r: r data./*note w: w data. data
     *3: *note k-ipc:: *note set: 3set.
     *4: https *note get: 4get.
     *5: *note ffi:::`f!"ifsIF"

     *note json::
     *note csv::
     *note lz4 zstd::

11.1 Example of Data I/O
========================

Let's begin with a simple example to write a sample table to csv and then read it back in again.  We'll use a function so the table can easily grow to a larger size.

      g:{+`s`f`i!(x?"abc";x?10.;x?10)} / generate function for table

     g[5]                              / generate table with 5 rows
     s f          i
     - ---------- -
     c 1.296544   4
     c 0.03771765 7
     c 3.371475   0
     b 1.352739   4
     b 1.187619   5

     `csv@g[5]                         / convert table to csv string
     "s,f,i\nb,1.08707,3\na,5.506882,0\nc,8.938667,1\nc,6.217895,6\nb,1.542842,6\n"

      "sample.csv"1:`csv@g[5]          / write to sample.csv file
     "sample.csv"

      1:"sample.csv"                   / read from file
     "s,f,i\na,3.669518,1\na,0.001226037,7\nb,2.792163,3\nc,8.539221,7\nb,9.333188,7\n"

      `csv?1:"sample.csv"              / read from file and convert from csv
     s f           i
     - ----------- -
     a 3.669518    1
     a 0.001226037 7
     b 2.792163    3
     c 8.539221    7
     b 9.333188    7

Given the small size of the file all this happens too quickly to notice the speed.  Let's give it a go with a bigger file.

      \t "sample.csv"1:`csv@g[_1e7]
     2587
      \t t:`csv?1:"sample.csv"
     388

Ten million rows via csv in under 1/2 a second.  Of course results will depend on hardware and number of columns also.

11.2 export, import csv => 'csv@x, `csv?x
=========================================

Enterprise only

csv tools allows one to export tables into csv and import from csv.  Generally these functions are used with file i/o '1:'

      "test.csv"1:`csv@[[]x:`a`b;y:3 2]  / write sample table to file
     "test.csv"

      `csv?1:"test.csv"                  / read csv from file
     x y
     - -
     a 3
     b 2

11.3 export, import json => 'json@x, `json?x
============================================

Export object x to json format or import string x from json format.  The json shared library will be automatically pulled from the Shakti website into the current directory.  Use of symbolic links with
path on the binary may cause issues.

      "test.json"1:`json@[[]x:`a`b;y:3 2]
     "test.json"

     `json?1:"test.json"
     (,"x";,"y")!(,"a";3)
     (,"x";,"y")!(,"b";2)

11.4 lz4 zstd => `lz4 `zstd
===========================

lz4 and zstd are compression algorythms which can be used to reduce the size of files.  As with other foreign libraries k9 does the work behind the scenes.  Here is an example of writing a large csv
file to disk and reading it back in.  In the second (lz4) and third (zstd) examples the csv's are compressed and decompressed with lz4 and zstd respectively.  One can look at the file sizes to see how
well the compression worked.

      g:{+`s`f`i!(x?"abc";x?10.;x?10)}

     "t.csv"1:`csv@g[_1e7]
     "t.csv"

========================

Output to x the list of strings in y.  y must be a list of strings.  If y is a single string then convert to list via *note list: enlist.

      ""0:("blue";"red")      / "" represents stdout
     blue
     red

      "file.txt" 0: ("blue"; "red") / write to file, one line per element

11.6 read line => 0:x
=====================

11.10 write data => x 2: y
==========================

Enterprise only

Save to file x non-atomic data y (e.g., lists, dictionaries, or tables).

This example saves 100 million 8-byte doubles to file.  The session is then closed and a fresh session reads in the file.  Both the write (420 ms) and compute statistics from the file have impressive
speeds (146 ms) given the file size (800 MB).

      n:_1e8
      r:+`a`b`c`d`e!5^n rand 1.;r
      `r 2:r              / write to file

Start new session.

11.11 IPC
=========

k9 has the ability to comunicate between separate k9 instances via inter-process communication (IPC). These processes can be on the same or separate machines.  A user will start multiple instances
specifying the port that the k9 session will use, opening a handle to that port, and then running remote commands via the handle and '3:' or '4:'.

11.12 k-ipc => 3:x
==================

Open a connection to port 'x' and return a handle.  If the port has been forwarded from another machine (eg.  ssh -L 1280:server.com:1280 laptop.com) then this handle allows remote execution.

      / before running this session start another k session in another
      / terminal window specifying that port 1251 should be used
      / k -p 1251
      h:3:1251 / create handle to port 1251 and save to h
      h        / h is an integer
     4

11.13 set => x 3:y
==================

Exectute string y using handle x.  Handle x should have already been created using k-ipc.  'set' is asynchronous, thus once the command is sent the session immediately returns to the user.

      h:3:1251               / create handle to port 1251
      h 3:"a:12"             / set a to 12 on remote session
      h 3:"n:_1e8;b:1?n?1."  / set b to a random number on remote

11.14 get => x 4:y
==================

Execute string y using handle x.  Handle x should have already been created using k-ipc.  'get' is synchronous, thus on the command is sent the session waits until there result is ready.

      h:3:1251               / create handle to port 1251
      h 3:"a:12"             / set a to 12 on remote session
      h 3:"n:_1e8;b:1?n?1."  / set b to a random number on remote

13 Tables
*********

k9 has the ability to store data in a tabular format containing named columns and rows of information as tables.  If the data to be stored and queried is large, then you should use tables.  This chapter
introduces the different types of data tables available in k9.  Table and utable are very similar and as you'll see in the *note kSQL:: chapter are easy to query.  In the *note Benchmark:: chapter,
you'll see that tables are fast to save, read, and query.

      *note table:: t:[[]n:`b`c;i:2 3]
     *note utable:: u: [[n:`b`c]i:2 3]

13.1 table
==========

The table is the most basic of the three types.  A table consists of columns and rows of information where each column has a name.  Tables can be created in three different ways (1) specification via
table format, (2) flipping a dictionary, or (3) reading in from a file.

13.1.1 Table format
-------------------

Tables can be created with the table square bracket notation.

As an example, let's create a table with two columns named "a" and "col2" having three rows.  The syntax is to surround the definition with square brackets and then have a first element of empty square
brackets.  Following those brackets comes first column name, colon, and the list of values, then the second column, and continuing for all the columns.  For keyed tables, the initial square brackets
will contain key column names as we will discuss later.

      [[] a:1 20 3; col2: 3.6 4.8 0.1]
     a  col2
     -- ----
      1 3.6
     20 4.8
      3 0.1

      [[] a:1; col2:3.6]   / will error :class as lists required
     [[] a:1; col2:3.6]

     :class

      [[] a:,1; col2:,3.6] / using list will succeed
     [[]a:,1;col2:,3.6]

13.1.2 Dictionary format
------------------------

Tables can also be created by flipping a dictionary into a table.

      +`a`col2!(1 20 3;  3.6 4.8 0.1)      / +columnnames!(values)
     a  col2
     -- ----
      1 3.6
     20 4.8
      3 0.1

13.1.3 File import
------------------

Tables can also be created by reading in a file.

t.csv
a, col2
1, 3.6
20, 4.8
3, 0.1

Use load file '2:x' which returns a table.

      2:`t.csv
     a   col2
     -- -----
      1  3.6
     20  4.8
      3  0.1

13.2 utable
===========

utable (or key table) is a table where some of the columns are keyed.  The combination of those columns should not have two rows with the same values.  This must be enforced by the application.

      [[d:2020.09.08 2020.09.09 2020.09.10]p:140 139 150]
     d         |p
     ----------|---
     2020.09.08|140
     2020.09.09|139
     2020.09.10|150

      `d^ [[]d:2020.09.08 2020.09.09 2020.09.10;p:140 139 150]

File: k9.info,  Node: kSQL,  Next: System,  Prev: Tables,  Up: Top

14 kSQL
*******

kSQL is a powerful query language for tables.  It has similarities to ANSI SQL but additional features to make it easier to work with ordered data, such as time series data.

     Database
     {*note select::|*note update::} *note A:: *note by B:: from T *note where C::; *note delete:: from T *note where C::

     *note Joins::
     x,y      / *note insert::, *note upsert::, *note union::, equi-and-asof *note leftjoin::
     x+y      / equi-and-asof outerjoin (e.g. combine markets through time)
     x#y      / take/intersect innerjoin
     x_y      / drop/difference

14.1 Queries
============

Queries can be done either via the kSQL or functional forms.  The kSQL form is general simplier to write while the functional form allows one to more easily run multithreaded or build queries
programmatically.

14.1.1 select
-------------

There a number of ways to return a complete table with kSQL. You can use the table name, a kSQL query without columns, or a fully specified query with columns.

      n:5;t:[[]x:!n;y:sin !n]
      t
     x y
     - ----------
     0 0.
     1 0.841471
     2 0.9092974
     3 0.14112
     4 -0.7568025

      select x,y from t
     x y
     - ----------
     0 0.
     1 0.841471
     2 0.9092974
     3 0.14112
     4 -0.7568025

      `x`y#t
     x y
     - ----------
     1 0.841471
     2 0.9092974
     3 0.14112
     4 -0.7568025

14.1.2 A
--------

A is the list of fields to return from the select or update query.  A can create new column names.

      n:5;t:[[]x:!n;y:sin !n];t
     x y
     - ----------
     0 0.
     1 0.841471

     0.14112    3
     -0.7568025 4

      `y`x#t
     y          x
     ---------- -
     0          0
     0.841471   1
     0.9092974  2
     0.14112    3
     -0.7568025 4

      select x,z:y from t  / create new column z
     x z
     - ----------
     0 0.
     1 0.841471
     2 0.9092974
     3 0.14112
     4 -0.7568025

14.1.3 by B
-----------

kSQL also has a way to group rows using 'by B'.  The result is a utable where the key is determined by the grouping clause.

      n:5;t:[[]x:!n;y:sin !n]
      select sum y by x>2 from t
     x|y
     -|----------
     0|1.750768
     1|-0.6156825

      t :+/'y@=x>2
     0|1.750768
     1|-0.6156825

14.1.4 where C
--------------

kSQL makes it easy to build up a where clause to filter down the table.  C is the list of constraints.

      n:5;t:[[]x:!n;y:sin !n]
      select from t where x>0
     x y
     - ----------
     1 0.841471
     2 0.9092974
     3 0.14112
     4 -0.7568025

      (:x>0)#t
     x y
     - ----------
     1 0.841471
     2 0.9092974
     3 0.14112
     4 -0.7568025

     select from t where (x>0), y within 0 .9
     x y
     - --------
     1 0.841471
     3 0.14112

      (:x>0;:y within .0 .9)#t
     x y
     - --------
     1 0.841471
     3 0.14112

14.1.5 Query with By and Where
------------------------------

      n:5;t:[[]x:!n;y:sin !n]
      select sum y by x>2 from t where y>0
     x|y
     -|--------
     0|1.750768
     1|0.14112

      ((:y>0)#t) :+/'y@=x>2
     0|1.750768
     1|0.14112

14.1.6 update
-------------

update allows one to modify values without specifying all the fields that pass through.  update is also used to add new columns in a table.  update does not, by itself, save the modifications to the
table.  If you want to preserve those modifications, use assignment.

      t:[[]x:`a`b`c;y:1 2 3];t
     x y
     - -
     a 1
     b 2
     c 3

      update y+18 from t
     x y
     - --
     a 19
     b 20
     c 21

      update z:y+18 from t
     x y z
     - - --
     a 1 19
     b 2 20
     c 3 21

      t:update z:y+18 from t; / save the updates into table t
      t                       / Now t has the updated values.
     x y z
     - - --
     a 1 19
     b 2 20
     c 3 21

14.1.7 delete
-------------

Delete rows from a table that satisfy one or more conditions.  Currently not working.

      t:[[]x:`a`b`c;y:1 2 1];t
     x y
     - -
     a 1
     b 2
     c 1

      delete from t where y>1
     !value

      delete from t where x=`c,y=1
     !nyi

14.2 Joins
==========

k9 has a number of methods to join tables together which are described below.  In this section t, t1 and t2 represent tables and k, k1 and k2 represent utables.

join                   syntax
*note union::          t1,t2
*note leftjoin::       t,k
*note outer::          k1,k2
*note asof::           t,k
*note asof+::          k1+k2

14.2.1 union join => t1,t2
--------------------------

Union join table t1 with table t2.  The tables should have the same columns and the join results in a table with t2 appended to t1.  If the tables do not have the same columns then return t1.

      t1:[[]s:`a`b;p:1 2;q:3 4]
      t2:[[]s:`b`c;p:11 12;q:21 22]
      t1

     - -- --
     a  1  3
     b  2  4
     b 11 21
     c 12 22

14.2.2 leftjoin => t,k
----------------------

leftjoin table t with utable k.  Result includes all rows from t and the values from table k having the same key values.  If a row of t has key values not found in k, then the t values are shown and 0
for the columns coming from k.

      t:[[]s:`a`b`c;p:1 2 3;q:7 8 9]
      k:[[s:`a`b`x`y`z]q:101 102 103 104 105;r:51 52 53 54 55]

     y|104 54
     z|105 55

      / t.s includes the value `c. Because k.s does not include c,
      / the last row shows a 0 under the r column (which comes from k).
      t,k
     s p q   r
     - - --- --
     a 1 101 51
     b 2 102 52

14.2.3 outer join => k1,k2
--------------------------

Outer join utable k1 and k2.

      k1:[[s:`a`b]p:1 2;q:3 4]
      k2:[[s:`b`c]p:9 8;q:7 6]

     -|- --
     a|1 10
     b|2 20
     c|3 30
     d|3 30

14.2.4 asof join => t,k
-----------------------

Asof joins each row rt of table t to a row rk in utable k (keyed by time) provided rk has the maximum time value of any row in k while obeying the constraint that the time value in rt >= the time value
of rk.  Intuitively, rk should be the row in k that is most up-to-date with respect to rt.

      t:[[]t:09:30+5*!5;p:100+!5];t

      / The k row at 09:41 is not linked with any t row.

      / are linked to the 09:32 row of k.

Scaling this up to a bigger set of tables one can see the performance of k9 on joins.

14.2.5 asof+ join => k1+k2
--------------------------

Asof+ joins allows one to aggregate over markets to find the total available at a given time.  The utables need to be specified with '`a'.  The effect is to merge the two key fields (the field t in this
case) and for each row rk1 from table k1, add the non-key field (bs in this case) from rk1 to the bs field of the most recent row in k2 whose t value is less than or equal to the t value in rk1.  And
symmetrically for each row of table k2.

      k1:`a [[t:09:30+5*!5]bs:100*1 2 3 2 1];k1
     t    |bs

     09:41|302
     09:45|203
     09:50|103

14.3 Insert and Upsert
======================

One can add data to tables via insert or upsert.  The difference between the two is that insert adds data to a table while upsert on some key x will replace the values if x is present in the target
table or insert x with its associated value otherwise.

14.3.1 insert => t,d
--------------------

Insert dictionary d into table t.
      t:[[]c1:`a`b`a;c2:1 2 7];t
     c1 c2
     -- --
     a   1
     b   2
     a   7

      t,`c1`c2!(`a;12)
     c1 c2
     -- --
     a   1
     b   2
     a   7
     a  12

      t,`c1`c2!(`c;12)
     c1 c2
     -- --
     a   1
     b   2
     a   7
     c  12

14.3.2 upsert => k,d
--------------------

Insert dictionary d into utable k.
      k:[[c1:`a`b`c]c2:1 2 7];k
     c1|c2
     --|--
     a | 1
     b | 2
     c | 7

15 System
*********

k9 comes with a few system functions and measurement commands.  The commands allow you to load a script, change the working directory, measure execution times and memory usage, and list defined
variables.

     System
     \l a.k  *note load::
     \t:n x  *note timing::

     \cd [d] *note cd::

15.1 load => \l a.k
===================

Load a text file of k9 commands.  The file name must end in .k.

      \l func.k
     \l func.k

     \l func.k9  / will error as not .k
     :nyi

15.2 timing => \t x or \t:n x
=============================

List time elapsed in milliseconds in evaluting x.  If n is supplied then repeat x, n times.

      \t ^(_10e6)? _1e8     / sort 10 million numbers
     227

      \t:10 ^(_10e6)? _1e8  / perform 10 times the sort

Though looping statements are not necessary in k9, if-then-else statements are sometimes useful.

$[b;t;f] cond

16.1 cond => $[b;t;f]
=====================

If b is non zero then x else y.  x and y are not required to be of the same type.

17 Temporal Functions
*********************

k9 has functions (within '.z') to get the current date and time to various degrees of precision.  There are also functions to retrieve partial date and time using dot notation.

date 2001.01.01   .z.d
time 12:34:56.789 .z.t

17.1 .z.[dm] date
=================

These functions retrieve the date as day (d) or month (m) precision.

      .z.d
     2020.12.13

      .z.m
     2020.12.

17.2 .z.[hrstuv] time
=====================

These functions retrieve the time at hour (h), minute (r), second (s), millisecond (t), microsecond (u), or nanosecond (v) precision.

      .z.h
     11
      .z.r
     11:25
      .z.s
     11:25:16
      .z.t
     11:25:16.842
      .z.u
     11:25:17.491362
      .z.v
     11:25:18.186360064

One could use the current time commands to measure run time but typically this is done via '\t'

      t1:.z.v;(_2e8)rand 1.;t2:.z.v;t2-t1
     00:00:00.609207008

     \t (_2e8)rand 1.
     610

17.3 Temporal dot functions
===========================

These functions use dot notation to retrieve partial date and times.

      now:.z.v;now
     11:27:18.049558016
      now.h
     11
      now.r

19 Examples
***********

This chapter presents an example from finance, as this is one of the primary application domains for k.  For those not familiar with this field, here is a short introduction.

19.1 A Tiny Introduction to Financial Market Data
=================================================

Finance has a large amount of data associated with it.  In this section finance data will be limited to price and transaction information which typically includes prices to buy and sell (called quotes)
and transactions (called trades).  This data includes the date, financial instrument symbol, time, and exchange / venue.  Additionally quotes will have a bid and ask price (where the deal is willing to
buy and sell) and trades will have a price and size of the reported transaction.

Although real prices are often shown as fractions of a whole amount, eg.  eurusd might be at 1.1904, the actual trades are dealt in whole cents or currencies so can be represented as integers.

Let's start with a simple example of only times (t), bid (b), and ask (a).

     n:10
      T:^10:00+`t n rand 36e5 / sort randomly generated times
      B:100++\-1+n rand 3     / generate bids near 100, equivalent to: 100 + (+\((-1)+n rand 3))
      A:B+1+n rand 2          / generates asks 1 or 2 higher
      q:+`t`b`a!(T;B;A);q     / build table t and then display
     t            b   a
     ------------ --- ---
     10:01:48.464 100 102
     10:23:12.033 100 102
     10:30:00.432 101 102
     10:34:00.383 101 103
     10:34:36.839 101 102
     10:42:59.230 100 102
     10:46:50.478 100 102
     10:52:42.189  99 100
     10:55:52.208  99 101
     10:59:06.262  98  99

Here you see that at 10:42:59.230 the prices update to 100 and 102.  The price one could sell is 100 and the price to buy is 102.  You might think that 100 seems a bit high so sell there.  Later at
10:59:06.262 you might have thought the prices look low and then buy at 99.  Here's the trade table for those two transactions.

      t:+`t`p!(10:43:00.230 10:59:07.262:;100 99);t
     t            p
     ------------ ---
     10:43:00.230 100
     10:59:07.262  99

You'll note that the times didn't line up, because it apparently took you a second to decide to trade.  Because of this delay, you'll often have to look back at the previous prices to join trade (t) and
quote (q) data.

Now that you've learned enough finance to understand the data, let's scale up to larger problems to see the power of k9.

19.2 Data Manipulation
======================

Let's use k9 to generate a set of random quotes for a particular day and symbol.

      qs:`date`sym`time`exch`bid`ask            / quote table schema
      nf:d+*|d:(|-d),d:683 954 997 1000;        / normal func
      D:#[;2021.03.17]                          / date
      S:#[;`eurusd]                             / symbol
      T:^?[;_8.64e7]@                           / time in number of milliseconds
      E:?[;"ce"]                                / exchange
      B:11904++\-3+nf bin/:?[;*|nf]@            / bid price, start at 12415
      P:?[;2,2,8#1]@                            / bid/ask spread
      Q:{+qs!((D;S;T;E)@'x),(*;+/)@\:(B;P)@'x}  / generator quote table
      q:Q@_1e8;10#q
     date       sym    time exch bid   ask
     ---------- ------ ---- ---- ----- -----
     2021.03.17 eurusd    0 c    11904 11905
     2021.03.17 eurusd    0 e    11904 11906
     2021.03.17 eurusd    2 e    11902 11903
     2021.03.17 eurusd    3 c    11902 11903
     2021.03.17 eurusd    9 c    11904 11906
     2021.03.17 eurusd    9 c    11904 11905
     2021.03.17 eurusd   10 c    11904 11905
     2021.03.17 eurusd   12 c    11904 11905
     2021.03.17 eurusd   12 c    11904 11905
     2021.03.17 eurusd   12 e    11904 11906

At this point let's run some basic statistics to see how quickly one can work with 100 million rows of data.  On a reletaviley recent consumer laptop the spread calculation (the longest calculation of
the bunch) is done in 350ms.

      select max bid,min ask from q
     bid|18449
     ask|5972

     select mid:avg 0.5*bid+ask from q
     [mid:14198.32]

     select spread:avg ask-bid from q
     [spread:1.200035]

     select first bid, first ask from q
     bid|11904
     ask|11905

     select last bid, last ask from q
     bid|14906
     ask|14907

19.3 Understanding Code Examples
================================

In the shakti mailing list there are a number of code examples that can be used to learn best practices.  In order to make sense of other people's codes, one needs to be able to efficiently understand
k9 language expressions.  Here is an example of how one goes about this process.

     ss:{*{
           o:o@&(-1+(#y)+*x@1)<o:1_x@1;
           $[0<#x@1;((x@0),*x@1;o);x]}[;y]/:(();&(x@(!#x)+\:!#y)~\:y)
           }

This function finds a substring in a string.

 000000000011111111112222222222333333
 012345678901234567890123456789012345
"Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text"

Here one would expect to find "++" at 9 and 29.

      ss["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
     9 29

In order to determine how this function works let's strip out the details...

     ss:{
         *{
           o:o@&(-1+(#y)+*x@1)<o:1_x@1; / set o
           $[0<#x@1;((x@0),*x@1;o);x]   / if x then y else z
           }
       [;y]/:(();&(x@(!#x)+\:!#y)~\:y)    / use value for inner function
       }


Given that k9 evaluates right to left, let's start with the rightmost code fragment.

      (();&(x@(!#x)+\:!#y)~\:y)          / a list (null;value)

And now let's focus on the value in the list.

      &(x@(!#x)+\:!#y)~\:y

In order to easily check our understanding, we can wrap this in a function and call the function with the parameters shown above.  In order to step through, we can start with the inner parenthesis and
build up the code until it is complete.

      {!#x}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
     {!#x}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
     ^
     :rank

This won't work as one cannot call a function with two arguments and then use only one.  In order to get around this, we will insert code for the second argument but not use it.

      {y;#x}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
     36
      {y;!#x}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ..

As might have been guessed '#x' counts the number of charcters in the first argument and then '!#x' generates a list of integers from 0 to n-1.

      {(!#x)+\:!#y}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
      0  1
      1  2
      2  3
      3  4
      4  5
      5  6
      6  7
      7  8
      8  9
      9 10
     10 11
     11 12
     12 13
     13 14
     14 15
     15 16
     16 17
     17 18
     18 19
     19 20
     20 21
     ..

Here the code takes each integer from the previous calculation and then adds an integer list as long as the second argument to each value.  In order to verify this, you could write something similar and
ensure the output what you predicted.

      {(!x)+\:!y}[6;4]
     0 1 2 3
     1 2 3 4
     2 3 4 5
     3 4 5 6
     4 5 6 7

Now using the matrix above the code indices as the first argument and pull substrings that match the length of the search string.

      {x@(!#x)+\:!#y}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
     Fi
     in
     nd
     d
      t
     th
     he
     e
      +
     ++
     ++
     +
      n
     ne
     ee
     ed
     dl
     le
     e
      i
     in
     ..

At this point one can compare the search substring in this list of substrings to find a match.

      {(x@(!#x)+\:!#y)~\:y}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]
     000000000110000000000000000001000000b

And then one can use the where function, '&', to determine the index of the matches.

      {&(x@(!#x)+\:!#y)~\:y}["Find the +++ needle in + the ++ text";"++"]

20.2 taxi
=========

The taxi data analysis problem has become well known given the ease of acquiring the data and the size of it.  It's well written up here
(https://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/) with a benchmark summary here (https://tech.marksblogg.com/benchmarks.html).  Shakti has a benchmark
script to generate simulated taxi data in order to check performance.

20.2.1 g
--------

Function to generate a table of random data to represent taxi company (t either yellow 'y or green 'g), paid fare (p 0-9), distance travelled (d 0-99) and address (a 0-100.).

      g:{[[]t:x rand`y`g;p:x rand 9;d:x rand 100;a:x rand 100.]}

     y 5 66 81.61647
     g 0 10 7.946983

20.2.2 x
--------

x is an ntable containing 2500 tables, keyed on day.  Each individual table contains 44,000 rows therefore x has 110 million rows in total.

      x:d!g':44000+&#d:2009.01.01+!2500  /110 million example
      x
     2009.01.01|[[]t:`y`y`g`y`g`g`y`y`g`g`g`g`g`y`y`y`y`g`g`g..

     ..

20.2.3 2009.01.04
-----------------

Let's work with a single table to understand the queries and limit it to 5 rows.

      q:5#x 2009.01.04;q
     t p d  a
     - - -- --------
     y 3 41 54.5307
     g 6 70 70.4241
     g 1 63 81.46645
     g 7 36 43.12615
     y 1 43 23.50114

Now let's count the number of rows by field t.  Looking at the data above you should expect 2 yellow (y) taxi trips and 3 green (g) taxi trips.

      select[t]count from q
     t|n
     -|-
     g|3
     y|2

We can also sum the paid fare (p) by taxi company (t).

      select[t]sum p from q
     t|p
     -|--
     g|14
     y| 4

Now if we want to compute the same over all the data we need to run the kSQL query over each table.  We'll do this on parallel threads (*note eachprior::) to speed it up.

      {select[t]count from x}':x
     2009.01.01|[[t:`g`y]n:21968 22032]
     2009.01.02|[[t:`g`y]n:21962 22038]
     2009.01.03|[[t:`g`y]n:21962 22038]
     2009.01.04|[[t:`g`y]n:21962 22038]

and then sum over all days.

      sum{select[t]count from x}':x
     t|n
     -|--------
     g|55010927
     y|54989073

Running the command with the timer will allow us to measure how long it takes to sum over the 110 million examples.

      \t sum{select[t]count from x}':x
     1077

21 Conclusion
*************

I expect you are pleasantly surprised by the speed of k9 and by the fact that it all fits in 134,152 bytes!  (For comparison the ls program weighs in at 51,888 bytes and can't even change directory.)

If you're frustrated by the syntax or terse errors, then you're not alone.  Many have had the same problems, but persevered, and finally came away a power user able to squeeze information from data
faster than previously imagined.

Eventually, you'll realize that this manual isn't needed and it's all here...
